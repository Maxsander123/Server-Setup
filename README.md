Features

    Automated Setup: Quickly install and configure necessary packages and dependencies (e.g., Nginx, Apache, Docker, etc.).
    Security Hardened: Includes basic firewall rules, SSH configurations, and other security best practices.
    Easily Customizable: Flexible scripts that can be tweaked to match your application’s requirements.
    Repeatable Environment: Avoid “works-on-my-machine” issues by standardizing server setup steps.

Prerequisites

    A fresh installation of your preferred Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS).
    Root or sudo privileges on the server.
    Installed utilities such as curl, wget, and git (depending on which scripts you plan to run).

Installation

    Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/Maxsander123/Server-Setup.git
cd Server-Setup

Review Scripts: Familiarize yourself with the scripts and their contents. It's good practice to confirm you trust each script before execution.

Make Scripts Executable (if needed):

    chmod +x ./scripts/*.sh

Usage

    Run the Main Setup Script (example command, depends on how you’ve structured the scripts):

./scripts/setup.sh

This script will install common packages, configure the firewall, set up SSH key authentication, and perform other tasks listed in its documentation or comments.

Check the Logs/Output: Keep an eye on the console output (and any log files) for errors or additional instructions.

Optional Scripts: Some scripts may be optional or specific to certain use cases, such as install_docker.sh, setup_web_server.sh, etc. Use them as needed:

    ./scripts/install_docker.sh
    ./scripts/setup_web_server.sh

    Customize Configuration: Adjust configuration files in the configs folder as desired (e.g., changing Nginx or Apache settings, SSH ports, and more).
